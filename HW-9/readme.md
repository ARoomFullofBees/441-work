This week was interesting. I'm glad I got to see The Coding Train videos. I decided to learn all about p5js.
I also followed his instructions to get my own local server, though it took a lot of troubleshooting to finally get it up and running. I was just using jsfiddle before, and it didn't help much.
I tried to do a more complex and unique site using NASA's api, but I ran into a lot of problems and confusion. I ended up making some adjustments to what I was working on
with the coding train videos adding a few other p5js features and the cloud data from the api.
