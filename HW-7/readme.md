Another challenging week. I was thankful to get the extension on this project, but it's still not where I want it to be. However, I'm working on both improving my javascript skills and my attitude towards coding. I'm trying to think of it more in terms of a card game like Skipbo. I had a hard time finding the right music and am still looking for an appropriate royalty-free instramental to go along with the theme of the page.
