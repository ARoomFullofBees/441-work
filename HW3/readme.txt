# HW-3 Readme for Valerie Rinder

Why did I take French instead of Creative Coding? I didn't know where to begin with this week; I had a fuzzy picture of what javascript was after reading the chapters, but had to suppliment them with many youtube tutorials of varying quality - the most useful of which was Javascript Fundamentals by LearnCode.academy. Still, it's been an extremely tough week. I chipped away at it every day, spending much of that time anxious, overwhelmed, and slightly nauseated. Had I known what I was in for, I would have prepared myself by both taking Creative Coding and cultvating a healthy amount of dread and despair towards the idea of coding for the past several years. Je suis une idiot.
