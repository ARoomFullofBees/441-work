Another challenging week. I was thankful to get the extension on this project. I'm working on both improving my javascript skills and my attitude towards coding. I'm trying to think of it more in terms of a card game where once you have the rules/syntax down, it becomes less unpleasant. I had a hard time finding the right music and am still looking for an appropriate royalty-free instramental to go along with the theme of the page.
