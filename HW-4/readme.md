# HW-4 Readme for Valerie Rinder

It's been a very difficult few weeks, but I feel like I'm starting to get a handle on the material. It's hard for me to think in terms of javascript and I'm still very shakey with the syntax, but I've been getting helpful information from other online sources like codecademy.com and various youtube videos.
